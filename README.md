## Project Description *(Software Lead)*
<< Give an overview of your project >>

***    

## User Interface Design *(Front End Specialist)*
* << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. >>
    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
* << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>
* ![start screen](assets/start_screen_drawing.png)
  * This is the start screen for our snake game, it contains the background of the game and a start button in the middle of the screen which when pressed will start the game.
* ![game screen](assets/game_screen_drawing.png)
  * This is the screen the player will see when the game first starts, as the game progresses the user will eat more fruit and then their snake will grow.
* ![game over screen](assets/game_over_screen_drawing.png)
  * This is the screen the user will see when they lose or complete the game, the score will update to show their final score.

## Program Design *(Backend Specialist)*
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

* assets
    * <all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here)
* etc
    * <This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project. Your demo video should go here.>
